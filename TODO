Some possible targets:

 - check new marge code on all tests
 - output merge as a diff from original
 - handle multi-file patchs, producing new patch or updating files
 - improve diff3 markers
 - modified
 - preserve permissions in created file
 - allow output to have just one stream selected of conflicts.
 - allow 'output' to include .rej files
 - fix "produced this was" -> "produced this way" in man page

other things
 - Read a series of patches and determine dependancies
   Then push a given patch forward or backward in the list.
   Possibly full determination of dependancies isn't needed.
   Just pust the target patch until it hits a wall, then
   push the wall as far as it goes.
   A potential 'wall' happens when inserted text is deleted.
   We refine A -> B -> C and see if it can be broken up with
   common a->a->a sections and between them,
    x->x->y or p->q->q
   There can then become x->y->y and p->p->q
   But suppose we find x->x->y and p->q->q with no
   a->a->a in between.  Are we allowed to handle that?

   This is a sentence
    (is -> was)
   This was a sentence
    (a -> my)
   This was my sentence
 
   Commutine the patches give
   This is a sentence
    (a -> my)
   This is my sentence
    (is -> was)
   This was my sentence

   That seems safe enough.  How about insertions and deletions?
    This a sentence 
     (add is)
    This is a sentence
      (remove a)
    This is sentence 

    This a sentence
      (remove a)
    This setence
      (add is)
    This is sentence

    Seems ok... Maybe the fact that we have perfect matches (no extraneous stuff)
    make it easier....


    So: first sort the blocks (well, the files) and see if there is any overlap
    of after-A with before-B.
    If not, we update offsets.  Maybe store each chunk as offset-from-end-of-last.
    If so, we extend both blocks, possibly including other blocks, to get two blocks
    that start and end at the same place.
    Then run a word-wise merge-like thing.  If there are no conflicts, extract the new
    intermediate file and create the new diff from that.

    So: each patch is a list of files with hunks
      the hunks may grow extra context as it is found in other hunks
       and may even merge.
     To commute two patches:
        If a chunk doesn't match any chunk in other file, just retain it.
        If it does, expand both chunks with common data from the other
         then run the diff code, then extract the new middle

I need to improve the browsing mode. Displaying before and
after on the one line doesn't work very well.
I think both the orignal/result and the before/after views need to
to have  -/+ lines for any difference.
So, for each newline we need to record whether there are any differences
on the line or not.  If there are, we will need to display that
line twice, once before and once after.
This means we need to acknowledge two 'line' cursor positions?
   Yes, if we are ever to have an edit cursor...
  But don't we only need to edit the 'after'
   Probably safer to provide for editing both as we might want to
   do that before reapplying the diff.

When we have consecutive newlines that are flagged, how do we display them?
Grouped or interleaved?
Grouped:
   - AAA
   - BBB
   + aaa
   + bbb
Interleaved
   - AAA
   + aaa
   - BBB
   + bbb
Grouped is what 'diff -u' generally does, however we know more about the 
content of the lines an whether it is a line that has been changed or a larger
chunk.  Maybe try one and see...

If a line only has additions, or only has deletions it might be safe to just
display the more complete line.. maybe leave that for wait-and-see too.

For Grouped diff, we need to locate a group. Maybe we flag newlines as
group-begin and group-end.

Need to think this through..

A 'pos' is the end of a line.  We only 'sit' on eols that are visible
We know the merger entry that covers this eol, and a position in one stream.
If whole line is in
    Unmatched, Unchange, Extraneous,
Then we just show the line undecorated.
If the line contins Changed, we show orig/result as separate lines.
If line contains Changed, AlreadyApplied or Conflict, we show before/after as separate lines

We, when we 'draw_mline'. We first do the 'before/orig' lines.
If there is a Changed we signal that we need a RESULT and put in a '-'
If there is a Changed, AlreadyApplied or Conflict, we signal the need for
        an AFTER and put in a '-'.
If either were needed, we put in another line

Grouped diff:
 as well as 'pos' we have start and end, and 'side'.
   start is the first line in the set containing pos that have CHANGES set.
   end is the last line in the same set
   size is either 0 if row is a ' ', -1 if a '-' or 1 if row is a '+'

 We need to allow for all of this when walking up and down for drawing lines.

TODO
 - what is 'cleanlist' meant to do - it seems to badly break things.
DONE - implemented Grouped diffs
DONE - at same time, lines with no diff should show no diff.
 - put line/col number is status bar
DONE - allow cursor to move left/right and scroll-on-demand.
 - If we have selected 'before', then don't show 'after' lines..
DONE - blank after end and before begining
 - better movement:
     DONE   top
     DONE   bottom
     DONE   next/prev diff
        next/prev conflict
        incr-search
        find char pos in search and highlight
        multiple finds per line
        search to loop around
	switch from forward to reverse.
     DONE   page up/down
     DONE   beginning/end of line
        left-right to handle line breaks.
 - handle single .rej file
 - allow updates to be saved
 - allow editing???
 - better colours? configurable?
