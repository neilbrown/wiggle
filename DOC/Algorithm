   An O (ND) Difference Algorithm and Its Variations
by EUGENE W. MYERS

However it isn't clear that I have the right to redistrubute this so
I've removed it.  It can easily be found by searching the internet.

The code in wiggle differs from the algorithm presented in that paper
in one fairly minor way.

The paper describes how to find an optimal path or "snake" through the
edit graph, but only stores the end-point and cost of the snake, not
the full path (as that would require order-n^2 space).

It then suggests that you run the same algorithm concurrently but in
reverse from the end of the graph towards the start.  When you find
that the longest snakes in both directions cross, you have a midpoint
on the path.

This is more useful than an end-point as you can recurse on either
side and build up the full path using linear space and only doubling
your work.

Wiggle takes a different approach.  Finding where the snakes cross
seemed awkward to me, and having two blocks of similar but not
identical code (one to search forward, one to search backwards) didn't
appeal at all.

So wiggle only searches forward, but it remembers where the half-way
line was crossed.  i.e. it remembers the 'x' value when x+y
changed from below to above (max_x + max_y)/2.
This uses much the same amount of storage, but significantly less code.
